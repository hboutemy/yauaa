The main reason is that the User-Agents so far have so much detailed information that it became so unique that some could be used as a device id for tracking purposes.
In addition, steps are taken to provide information to website builders that is intended to be sufficient for running a website and less prone to tracking people.</description></item><item><title>Memory usage</title><link>/using/memoryusage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/using/memoryusage/</guid><description>The system relies heavily on HashMaps to quickly find the rules that need to be fired.
Some fields only require a handful of rules where others have a lot of them. This means that it depends on the fields that have been requested how many rules are kept in the system and thus how much memory is used to store the rules in. To get an idea of the relative memory impact of the rules needed for a specific field.</description></item><item><title>The demonstration webservlet</title><link>/using/webservlet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/using/webservlet/</guid><description>Part of the distribution is a war file that is a servlet that has a webinterface and some APIs that allow you to try things out.
This servlet can be downloaded via
&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;nl.basjes.parse.useragent&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;yauaa-webapp&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;7.26.1&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;war&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt; NOTE that this is a DEMONSTRATION servlet!
It is simply the library in a servlet, no optimizations or smart memory settings have been done at all.
Docker Starting with version 5.14.1 the webservlet is also published to the central docker registry.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes</title><link>/using/kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/using/kubernetes/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Kubernetes and the code below &amp;ldquo;works on my cluster&amp;rdquo;.
